            <p >This is an overview of the Web Programming course at Stonehill College. <a target="_blank" href="https://stonehill.edu">Visit Stonehill's homepage.</a></p>
            <p>In this class, we'll learn about the entire web development stack, including front-end, back-end and database technologies.</p>
            <section>
                <h2>Front-End:</h2>
                    <p>Front End refers to the part of the web development stack that happens on the client computer. This involves the structure, the styling, and the behavior.</p>

                    <p>The languages used for front-end development are:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                        <li>JavaScript</li>
                    </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Back-End:</h2>
                    <p>Back-End refers to the part of web development stack that happens on the server computer. This involves communicating with and updating the database, checking user privileges (authentication and authorization) and much more.</p>

                    <p>The languages one could use for back-end are myriad (e.g., Django in python, Ruby on Rails in ruby, PHP). In this class, we will use NodeJS to reduce the number of new languages we have to learn.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Databases:</h2>
                    <p>Databases are where we store information that is likely to change (think passwords, emails, large databases of articles like on a news site).</p>

                    <p>Databases are also "hosted" on the server side. While they can be hosted on the same server as the back-end, it is generally good practice to host a database on its own server.</p>

                    <p>For this class, we will use MongoDB (a NoSQL database) to stick to that JavaScript lifestyle.</p>
